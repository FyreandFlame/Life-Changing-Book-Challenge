  <title>Life Changing Book</title>

<body>
  <div>Every reader has that one book that they can't let go of. It gets stuck in your head and you come back to it over and over. For me, that book is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_(novel)" target="_blank">Junk</a> (AKA Smack in the US) by Melvin Burgess.
  Written in November 1996, I personally read this book at a young age, maybe 13 years old, and it has stuck with me ever since. As a person who grew up in an area that is, shall we say, poor, I grew up knowing the dangers of drugs and knowing that my peers and their parents were heavily involved with drugs.
  Drugs were so common in my area that my school regularly held classes warning of the dangers of drugs. These classes still go on today, almost 20 years later.

Now, some people will see this way of life as low class and demand the children are removed, however, lets be honest, everyone has issues and everyone needs help but it doesn't always help to remove the children. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion on this matter though.
</div>
</br>
<div>  So now, you can see why I had an interest in Junk at such a young age but the drug use is not why it stuck with me. This book was more than just saying "these kids are ruining their lives, let's read along and see what happens". For me, this was more about the relationships and the struggles real people can have and why they may turn to drugs. In no way, would I personally condone drug use but Junk showed me the thought process and the reasoning that could be behind a person becoming an addict. This is something I can understand. It's not all about drugs, it's the abuse that the outside world doesn't recognise, it's the build up and break down of relationships, the friends you gain and lose and how your entire life can revolve around that next fix. This is no way for anyone to live, and even though this is a fictional novel, so many people around the world, it could even be your next door neighbour, are struggling with so many things and turn to drugs as a reprieve.</div>
</br>
<div>
   I believe that everyone deserves kindness in their lives, not judgement and Junk always reminds me of this. People aren't "Junkies" for the sake of it, it's an escape. It's not the right way to deal with our problems but for some, it seems to be the only way. This novel has pushed my thinking process and my understanding of mental health issues. When it comes down to it, everyone who uses drugs has something they need to deal with under the surface. As a society, we need to provide that support to people, preferrably before they fall down the rabbit hole. One hit always leads to another and many people can't get up before rock bottom. Without help, some people will never get back up.
</div></br> <div> If you have never read Junk, then I highly recommmend it. It's more than just a story, it's a tale of pain, sorrow, abuse, and most importantly, the harsh reality of humanity.</div>
